```
 this is a test
```

```
**[terminal]
**[prompt foo@joe]**[path ~]**[delimiter  $ ]**[command ./myscript]
Normal output line. Nothing special here...
But...
You can add some colors. What about a warning message?
**[warning [WARNING] The color depends on the theme. Could look normal too]
What about an error message?
**[error [ERROR] This is not the error you are looking for]
```
